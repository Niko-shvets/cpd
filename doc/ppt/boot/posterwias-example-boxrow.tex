A barge  arrived at the  scene of the  Gulf of Mexico oil  spill today
carrying a  five-storey, 100-tonne containment  dome that it  is hoped
will stem the leak that is threatening the US coast.

Engineers believe that the dome  could be the best short-term solution
to controlling the 220,000 gallons  of oil being spewed into the water
each day  since an  explosion at the  Deepwater Horizon rig  two weeks
ago. The technique has not been tested before at such depths.

Neanderthal DNA may be commonplace  in human genomes outside Africa as
a  result  of  interbreeding  around  60,000  years  ago.  Photograph:

There  is a  little  Neanderthal in  nearly  all of  us, according  to
scientists who compared the genetic  makeup of humans with that of our
closest ancient relatives.

Most people living outside Africa can trace up to 4\% of their DNA to a
Neanderthal  origin, a  consequence of  interbreeding between  the two
groups after the great migration from the contintent.

\wiasbox{2}{Anthropologists have long speculated  that early humans may have mated
with  Neanderthals,  but  the  latest  study  provides  the  strongest
evidence  so far, suggesting  that such  encounters took  place around
60,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region of the Middle East.

\wiasbox{4}{
Small, pioneering groups of modern humans began to leave Africa 80,000
years ago and reached land occupied by the Neanderthals as they spread
into Eurasia.  The two  may have lived  alongside each other  in small
groups until the Neanderthals died out 30,000 years ago. }
