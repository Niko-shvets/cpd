This paper presented new change point detection method that works in offline  and online modes. The method accounts properties of LRT statistic, which has shifted $\chi^2$-distribution. Bootstrap technique appeared to be rather effective for  LRT  critical values calibration. Experiments and quality measurements confirm stability of the proposed algorithm in possibility to detect change points with different significance. The introduced concept of patterns allows to reveal different types of change point and filter regions with outliers.
